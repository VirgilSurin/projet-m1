abstract = {We revisit the maximal clique enumeration algorithm cliques by Tomita et al. that appeared in Theoretical Computer Science in 2006. It is known to work in O(3n/3)-time in the worst-case for an n-vertex graph. This is worst-case optimal with respect to the input size, but there is little knowledge about its performance with respect to the output. In this paper, we extend the time-complexity analysis with respect to the maximum size and the number of maximal cliques, and to its delay, solving issues that were left as open problems since the original paper. In particular, we prove that cliques has Ω(3n/6) delay and that, even if we allow to change the pivoting strategy, a variant having polynomial delay cannot be designed unless P=NP. These same results apply to the related Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. On the positive side, we show that the complexity of cliques and Bron-Kerbosch is amortized polynomial on graphs with logarithmic clique number. As these algorithms are widely used and regarded as fast “in practice”, we are interested in observing their practical behavior: we run an evaluation of cliques and three Bron-Kerbosch variants on over 130 real-world and synthetic graphs, observing how the clique number almost always satisfies our logarithmic constraint, and that their performance seems far from its theoretical worst-case behavior in terms of both total time and delay.1}

abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.}
